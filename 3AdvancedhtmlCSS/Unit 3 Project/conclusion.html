            <li>Birth rates</li>
            <li>Tourist attractions</li>
        </ol>
        <p><em>All of these reasons listed above describe the purpose of this whole website, which is to
                explain what population is, and how it is effected altogether.

        <p>Knowing and understanding population densities are <strong><em>very</em></strong> important for
            our world, because it helps us plan for the future. This allows us to express the need on any
            infastructures needed in different areas of the world according to the birth rates in that area.
            In this way, we could better sustain life, and improve on our world today.</p>
