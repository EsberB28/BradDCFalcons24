            <p>The population of the entire world as of today is 8.2 billion. It is estimated that we have had
                a 0.9% increase during each annual change as of 2023.

            <h2>Affecting Factors</h2>
            <p>We've mentioned before some factors that effect population, both in areas and in general. The
                world population tends to follow one of the same reasons: Birth rates. This includes both the
                increases/decreases, and is affected by multiple factors such as:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Healthcare</li>
                <li>Abortions</li>
                <li>Social Factors</li>
                <li>Cost of living</li>
            </ul>
        </article>
        <h2>Healthcare</h2>
        <p>Healthcare is one of the biggest factors that affects birth rates across the world. It is what assists
            mothers during times of labor, and so on. Healthcare is crucial to the world, because it helps with births
            by increasing its rates. Without it, hundreds of thousands of embryos wouldn't even become babies.
        </p>
        <h2>Abortions</h2>
        <p>Another huge factor of birth rates is abortions. Abortions are the killing of babies before they are even
            born.
            This plays a negative role in the world, because it leads to birth rates decreasing, and innocent lives
            being lost.
            Some reasons a woman in labor might want to do this is because of their own health, the stress of having to
            deal with
            a baby, and so on.
        </p>
        <h2>Social Factors</h2>
        <p>Social factors that affect birth rates include marriages and divorces. When couples are married, this allows
            an increase to
            birth rates, which is a big plus. Divorces, on the other hand, follow stress as it leads to the break up of
            two individuals
            who at one point swore themselves to love each other. Divorces can have a big impact on any children the
            couple had (if they
            had any), because their children would grow up with that memory, and potentially not seek for marriage.
        </p>
        <h2>Cost of living</h2>
        <p>The final factor, cost of living, impacts families. If they could not afford shelter or food (if they could a
            poor ammount), they
            wouldn't be able to afford a healthy lifestlye. This also means that, if the mother was in labor, couldn't
            safely give birth to
            children, as there would be a high chance of death if the woman did it out of a hospital
        </p>
        <p>These factors overall affect our world's population, with both positive and negative effects.</p>
