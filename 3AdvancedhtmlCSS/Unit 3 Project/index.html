    <h1>Population</h1>
    <h3>What is population?</h3>
    <p>Population is the entirety of inhabitants occupying a certain area
        (different countries or just the world in general) which is always
        changed and modified. This is done based on increasing (births and immigration)
        or decreasing (deaths or emigration) modifications.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>So... what is this use of knowledge useful for? <strong>Why is it important
        to know your population density?</strong></p>
    <p>Well... knowing and understanding the population densities of different areas
        are <strong><em>very important,</em></strong> because they hold the given information 
        that tells the government what necessities are needed to be met for everyone in that 
        area to stay alive. This means that the government provides different areas with different 
        ammounts of food based on how many people live in that area.
    </p>
    <p>Another reason the government uses population density data is to identify the overall 
        ammount of people from each culture who live in an area. They also determine more specific 
        details, such as their age, sex, occupation, language, and so on. Population density data is 
        a fancy way to say the counting of people in different areas.
