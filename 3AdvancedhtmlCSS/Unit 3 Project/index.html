            <h3>What is population?</h3>
            <p>Population is the entirety of inhabitants occupying a certain area
                (different countries or just the world in general) which is always
                changed and modified. This is done based on increasing (births and immigration)
                or decreasing (deaths or emigration) modifications. Since the older years, the
                world's population has surpassed 8 <strong>billion</strong> people. At 1 A.D.,
                the population was only at about 300 million, and by the 1800s, it reached 1
                billion.

            <p><em>Above is the recorded population of the U.S. as of 2025; you can see that the eastern
                    area is more popular and crowded, since they are more urban. The western side is less
                    crowded, since it is more suburban.

            <p>So... what is this use of knowledge useful for? <strong>Why is it important
                    to know population density? What does it even mean?</strong></p>
            <p>Well... knowing and understanding the population densities of different areas
                are <strong><em>very important,</em></strong> because they hold the given information
                that tells the government what necessities are needed to be met for everyone in that
                area to stay alive. This means that the government provides different areas with different
                ammounts of food based on how many people live in that area.
            </p>
            <p>Another reason the government uses population density data is to identify the overall
                ammount of people from each culture who live in an area. They also determine more specific
                details, such as their age, sex, occupation, language, and so on. Population density is a
                fancy way to say the counting of people in different areas.

            <p>Population is something crucial to interpret, because it allows higher officials to make
                decisions accordingly that would best fit a given area, and affects how people live. Since
                it also specifies on people's background information, it allows the government to build
                infrastructures accordingly (such as schools, hospitals, and grocery stores). Population also
                allows the government to plan ahead based on the trends they see in the data. This means that
                they are making decisions based on an incline or decline in population that would best benefit
                the future of that area.
            </p>
            <p>Population also affects how others live, based on the ammount of inhabitants in a specific area.
                The more people living in an area, the more tangibles they'll need to survive, and the less people
                livng in an area, they less they need. A larger population would also mean smaller houses because
                of the ammount of people living in that area, while a smaller population would mean more room to
                live in larger households.
