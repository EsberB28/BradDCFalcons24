        <h1>Population of Top 10 Countries</h1>
    </header>

    <main>
        <p>Population is always changing. This is based on people's interests of
            whether they stay to live in a certain country or not. As of 2025, the
            top 10 countries with the highest populations are:
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>India (1,463,865,525)</li>
            <li>China (1,416,096,094)</li>
            <li>United States (347,275,807)</li>
            <li>Indonesia (285,721,236)</li>
            <li>Pakistan (255,219,554)</li>
            <li>Nigeria (237,527,782)</li>
            <li>Brazil (212,812,405)</li>
            <li>Bangladesh (175,686,899)</li>
            <li>Russia (143,997,393)</li>
            <li>Ethiopia (135,472,051)</li>
        </ol>
        <em>These are the biggest countries in the world, which makes sense why they
            have the biggest populations.
        </em>
        <p>Some reasons these countries could have such a large population include 
            multiple different factors. To start off, birth rates could be increased in 
            other areas, which leads to a higher popuation density. Some other reasons
            besides the main one listed above include:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Tourist Attractions</li>
            <li>Economic factors (urban vs suburban)</li>
            <li>Historical factors</li>
        </ul>
