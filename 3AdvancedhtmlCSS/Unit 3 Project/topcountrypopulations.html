            <p>Population is always changing. This is based on people's interests of
                whether they stay to live in a certain country or not. As of 2025, the
                top 10 countries with the highest populations are:
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>India (1,463,865,525)</li>
                <li>China (1,416,096,094)</li>
                <li>United States (347,275,807)</li>
                <li>Indonesia (285,721,236)</li>
                <li>Pakistan (255,219,554)</li>
                <li>Nigeria (237,527,782)</li>
                <li>Brazil (212,812,405)</li>
                <li>Bangladesh (175,686,899)</li>
                <li>Russia (143,997,393)</li>
                <li>Ethiopia (135,472,051)</li>
            </ol>

            <em>These are the biggest countries in the world, which makes sense why they
                have the biggest populations.

            <p>Some reasons these countries could have such a large population include
                multiple different factors. To start off, birth rates could be increased in
                other areas, which leads to a higher popuation density. Some other reasons
                besides the main one listed above include:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Tourist Attractions</li>
                <li>Economic factors (urban vs suburban)</li>
                <li>Historical factors (reasons that trace back hundreds of years ago)</li>
            </ul>
            <p>These factors listed above are the main reasons a country may have a larger
                population. Many of these countries have some of the biggest tourist attractions
                in the world.

            <p>Another reason mentioned above as to why these countries have the largest populations in the world
                is because of their economic factors. To break it down, this basically lies between urban and
                suburban areas.
            </p>
        </section>
        <article>
            <h3>Urban</h3>
            <p>Urban means an area that is often close to cities, and focuses on groups of people living together. This
                differs greatly from suburban, because urban life allows smaller room for individuals to live in, which
                means
                that these city areas are always crowded with people.
            </p>
            <h3>Suburban</h3>
            <p>Suburban means an area is often away or spread out from others; this means that individuals tend to live
                in
                farms
                just beyond a city's border. This differs from urban life, because individuals are allowed much more
                land to
                live on,
                while being more spread out.
            </p>
        </article>
        <section>
            <h2>Historical Factors</h2>
            <p>As mentioned above, the final reason as to why countries have these large populations is because of their
                history. A lot
                has happened in the past, and this contributes greatly to the settlement of hundreds of thousands of
                people
                in a certain
                area. Some of these factors include:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Ways of life back then</li>
                <li>Wars/battles fought before</li>
                <li>Empires</li>
            </ul>
            <p>These are some of the few factors that contribute to people's settlement in countries, which affects
                their
                population. Some of
                these reasons, such as empires, date hundreds of years back, and until now effect one's decisions.
