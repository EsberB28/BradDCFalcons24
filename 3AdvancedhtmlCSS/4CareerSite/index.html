    <h1>Neurology: Study of the Brain</h1>
    <h2>Neurology falls in the study of medicine, as it is involved in the 
        area of neuroscience, and focuses on the brain, spinal cord, and the 
        peripheral nerves.
    </h2>
    <p>I am interested in studying neurology because I would like to study medicine 
        when I get older, and I'm interested in studying the brain. I think it is an 
        amazing opportunity to be able to learn how the brain functions, and even 
        operating on one. Most importantly, I would like to save lives, and help others
        with any neurological diseases or disorders.
