        <h1>Neurology: Study of the Brain</h1>
    </header>
    <main>
        <h2>Neurology falls in the study of medicine, as it is involved in the
            area of neuroscience, and focuses on the brain, spinal cord, and the
            peripheral nerves.
        </h2>
        <p>I am interested in studying neurology because I would like to study medicine
            when I get older, and I'm interested in studying the brain. I think it is an
            amazing opportunity to be able to learn how the brain functions, and even
            operating on one. Most importantly, I would like to save lives, and help others
            with any neurological diseases or disorders.
        </p>
