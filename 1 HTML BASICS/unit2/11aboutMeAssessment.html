    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <strong>Welcome to my webpage!</strong>
    <p>My name is Brad, and I love socializing and making friends. I am an easy
        going guy, and I love my family. I am interested in carrying out a career
        that focuses in medicine, so Harvard is my go-to college. My goal in the
        future is to be able to retire early, and overall enjoy my life with my
        family and friends.

    <p><em>The following lists describe what my top 5's are for each topic:</em></p>

    <div style ="background-color:#d0ade6;">
    <h3>Sports</h3>
    <p>I love sports, and enjoy both playing and watching them live.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Soccer.</strong> This is my #1 sport, because I really like their players and teams.</li>
        <li><strong>Basketball.</strong> I love practicing my basketball shots, and watching different
            teams compete.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Swimming.</strong> I like to swim, and every summer I go to a pool and swim for hours.</li>
        <li><strong>Hockey.</strong> I think hockey is a fun sport because it's a sport on ice, which makes it
            more challenging.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Golf.</strong> I think golf is a nice, relaxing sport to watch, and very impressive
            to be able to send a golfball hundreds of feet away.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Career Choices</h3>
    <p>Below are the careers I am interested in to do in the future.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Doctor.</strong> I like studying medicine, so I'm very interested in specializing
            in that field.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Engineer.</strong> I was interested in building things since a kid, and I think
            engineers are valued a lot in society.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Principal.</strong> I think being the head of the school is important to guide
            everyone towards the right path.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Teacher.</strong> I think it would be cool to teach smaller children to help them
            develop for the future.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Mechanic.</strong> I like fixing things, and I always thought mechanics were intelligent
            based on all their knowledge about vehicles.
        </li>
    </ul>
