        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>Dogs are my favorite animal, because I have always loved how adorable
            and loyal they are. I have a dog myself, and she's a
            <a href = "https://www.petguide.com/breeds/dog/cheagle/">cheagle</a> (chihuahua-beagle mix).
            She is just over a year old, and ever since we got her, I felt like my overall 
            happiness/mood increased to the plus side. I've never been happier everyday once 
            I got home to see her waiting for me patiently with her tail wagging.

        <h2>Diversity and Activity</h2>
        <p>Every dog person has a different preference. One thing I <strong>love</strong> about
        dogs are their variety. Take a chihuahua and a great dane, for instance. Each dog has its own
        personality, which makes them <em>even more</em> loveable. They also come in all sorts of
        colors, to tend to each persons' desires. Everyone has their own favorite kind of dog, which 
        is why they are very diverse. There are <strong>countless</strong> options when choosing a dog
        to add to your family, and each one shows you a ton of affection.</p>

        <p>Dogs are known for being playful. Each dog comes with a bundle of fun because of the amount
        of energy they have. They <strong>always</strong> enjoy any game they partake in, and this energy
        keeps them active, which ultimately results in more happy/joyful memories. This also pushes you to
        exercise more because of them since you have to walk them a few times everyday. Studies show that
        people's health overall increased because of the amount of exercise done from walking/playing with your dog.

        <h3>Loyalty</h3>
        <p>Dogs are known as <em>"Man's best friend"</em> for a reason. They love their owner since day 1,
        and don't leave their side. They provide you with company at all times, preventing you from any
        loneliness. Researchers explored how dogs would react to their owners when they were upset, and compared 
        that to how they would react with complete strangers when they were upset. In the end, whether the owner
        or stranger cried, the dog would nuzzle and sniff each alike. Since dogs <strong>love</strong> their owner,
        they endure through whatever to stay at your side, which is <b><i>truly</i></b> an amazing thing.</p>
