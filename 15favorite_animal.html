        <p>Dogs are my favorite animal, because I have always loved how adorable
            and loyal they are. I have a dog myself, and she's a
            <a href = "https://www.petguide.com/breeds/dog/cheagle/">cheagle</a> (chihuahua-beagle mix).
            She is just over a year old, and ever since we got her, I felt like my overall 
            happiness/mood increased to the plus side.

        <h2>Diversity</h2>
        <p>Every dog persob has a different preference. One thing I <strong>love</strong> about
        dogs is their variety. Take a chihuahua and a great dane, for instance. Each dog has its own
        personality, which makes them <em>even more</em> loveable. They also come in all sorts of
        colors, to tend to each persons' desires.</p>

        <h3>Loyalty</h3>
        <p>Dogs are known as <em>"Man's best friend"</em> for a reason. They love their owner since day 1,
        and don't leave their side. They provide you with company at all times, preventing you from any
        loneliness. Since dogs <strong>love</strong> their owner, they ednure through whatever to stay at
        your side, which is <b><i>truly</i></b> an amazing thing.</p>
