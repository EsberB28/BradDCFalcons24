<title>My Favorite Band</title>
<h1>Backstreet Boys</h1>
<hr>
<p><strong><em>Backstreet Boys</em></strong> is my favorite band, because I've heard many of their songs before,
the most famous one being "I Want it That Way".</p>
<p>I first heard this as a kid, and, on my first time hearing it,
I was attached to the song. The beat never gets old, and the pitches of their voices during the song is perfection.

<p>I personally don't think that the Backstreet boys will <strong><em>ever</em></strong> get old, because their iconic music will continue to be passed down
through each generation to come. I think their music is one of the highest regarded songs in the world.
