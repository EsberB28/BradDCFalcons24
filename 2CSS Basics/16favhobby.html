        <h1>My Favorite Hobby</h1>
        <p><strong>My favorite hobby is traveling. I love visiting new places around the world,
                and I've yet to explore so many countries. Each country is unique in their
                own way, and that's what makes this world so diverse and thrilling.</strong>

        <h2>The Mediterranean</h2>
        <p id="p">3 years ago I traveled to Lebanon. It was one of the most exciting vacations I've ever had.
            To start off, I got to meet my big family, and I was introduced to so many new and unique foods.
            I got to travel to so many different cities, one of them being the largest city, Beirut. I loved
            traveling to Lebanon, because everyone was very kind and respectful to one another. This year I
            plan on going to the Mediterranean for vacation, in hopes of exploring Greece.
        </p>
        <p>Below is a following list of my top vacation spots in the Mediterranean:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Lebanon</li>
            <li>Egypt</li>
            <li>Jordan</li>
            <li>Turkey</li>
            <li>Morocco</li>
        </ol>
        <img src="imgs/2Lebanon.jpg" alt="Lebanon" width="300px" height="300px">
        <img src="imgs/2Egypt.jpg" alt="Egypt" width="400px" height="200px">
        <img src="imgs/2Turkey.jpg" alt="Turkey" width="350px" height="250px">
        <p class="p2"><em>Above are three different pictures on three of the mentioned countries above.
                The picture to the left is an image of Beirut, Lebanon. The picture in the
                middle is a picture of the pyramids in Egypt. The final picture is a picture
                of Istanbul, Turkey. All of these countries have one thing in common: They all
                have an awestriking view, which attracts hundreds of thousands of tourists to
                their cities.

        <h2>Asia</h2>
        <p><strong>I always thought that Asia was a really vivid place to live in. Since it has hundreds
            of countries, there is so much to explore. Asia has some countries with the largest
            populations in the world, including China and India. Asian food is amazing, because
            their dishes are extremely unique and delicious. Asia is a place I hope on visiting
            sometime in the next few years.

        <img src="imgs/2Mount Fuji.jpg" alt="Mount Fuji" width="400px" height="300px">
        <p class="p3">The above pictures are on three of the largest things Asia is known for. The first picture
            is an image of sushi at the left, and this is one of my favorite dishes. The second picture
            in the middle is Taj Mahal, which is located in India and is visited hundreds of millions of
            times every year. The final picture is one of the most beautiful pictures I've ever seen, and
            that is Mount Fuji. This mountain is found in Japan, and it is truly something marvelous to look
            at.
