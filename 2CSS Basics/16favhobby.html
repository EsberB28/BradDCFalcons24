        <h1>My Favorite Hobby</h1>
        <p><strong>My favorite hobby is traveling. I love visiting new places around the world,
                and I've yet to explore so many countries. Each country is unique in their
                own way, and that's what makes this world so diverse and thrilling.</strong>

    <h2>The Mediterranean</h2>
    <p>3 years ago I travelled to Lebanon. It was one of the most exciting vacations I've ever had.
        To start off, I got to meet my big family, and I was introduced to so many new and unique foods.
        I got to travel to so many different cities, one of them being the largest city, Beirut. I loved
        travelling to Lebanon, because everyone was very kind and respectful to one another.
